## Probably not relevant
- Intel HD Card full MHz: https://www.ntlite.com/community/index.php?threads/intel-r-hd-graphics-4600-tweak-always-full-mhz.1084/
    - Set gpu frequency easier to 848Mhz. Useful?
- [GeDoSaTo](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424124847/http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?page_id=582) downsampling of resolution
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/8127op/cant_install_gedosato_anymore/
    - Probably useless for improving performance having already HiAlgoBoost
- Increase VRAM. It shouldn't effect performance except for games that checks how much VRAM a GPU got. [ref](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/video-ram-windows-10/)
    - Does not work with new Intel drivers
- Intel PHDGD Driver now: https://youtu.be/BZG50Nm5sOM?t=192
    - they don't work on the current intel GPU gen
- [CPUCore](https://store.steampowered.com/app/384300/CPUCores__Maximize_Your_FPS/)
    - it'snot free

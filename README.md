# GPD WIN 2 M3-8100y - Tips and Tweaks library

The goal of this library/wiki is to collect and organize all the tweaks, drivers, guides and software I find on the way to get the best experience possible out of the GPD WIN 2 M3-8100y.

**IMPORTANT:** From now on, Whenever I write "GPD WIN 2" I'll implicitly refer to the M3-8100y revision.

Enjoy it and feel free to contribute!
